        Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living, Newman?</p>
    <p>NEWMAN<br>
        I'm a United States postal worker.</p>
    <p>GEORGE<br>
        Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back with a gun and
        shoot everybody?</p>
    <p>NEWMAN<br>
        Sometimes...</p>
    <p>JERRY<br>
        Why is that?</p>
    <p>JERRY<br>
        Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and
        coming, there's never a let-up. It's relentless. Every day it piles up
        more and more and more! And you gotta get it out but the more you get
        it out the more it keeps coming in. And then the barcode reader breaks
        and it's *Publisher's Clearing House* day!!!</p>
